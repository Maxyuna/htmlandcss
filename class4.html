    In antiquity the city was known under the ancient Greek name of Λυχνίς (Lychnis) and Λυχνιδός (Lychnidos) and the Latin Lychnidus,[8][9] probably meaning "city of light", literally "a precious stone that emits light",[10] from λύχνος (lychnos), "lamp, portable light".[11] Polybius, writing in the second century BC, refers to the town as Λυχνίδιον - Lichnidion.[12]
